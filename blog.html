  <div class="panel">
<p > The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about searching for a topic that has peaked my own interest . The purpose of this blog is to give others an idea of new info you have learned over a topic. I am doing 3D Modeling and studying the Science behind it and the Art and representation of 3D Modeling. I had to change science to technology because it seemed more relatable to technology then science. </p> </div>

<button class= "accordion"><h3> Blog #2 </h3></button>

<div class= "panel"><p> I remember in class we did linear gradient and I’m using that to make my project have more pop to it. I remember during class we also learned how to put text over shapes learning that allowed me to put my text over my colored rectangle to make my website cover. Also, learned to do shapes with text inside of them was really helpful when making my logo. The colors came out really good with the gradient.

 <button class= "accordion"><h3> Blog #3</h3></button>

<div class= "panel"><p> I learned Accordion over online learning and let me say it has been so useful and it is a better to organize my info in certain areas. Like, for example my homepage I had to change the design because the front page of my site didn't the way I wanted it to look and I felt like it was missing something. So, when I added the accordion to my frontpage it looked so good because it look orgainzed.

 <button class= "accordion"><h3> Blog #4</h3></button>

<div class= "panel"><p> For the feedback I had Gavin and Jenny look at my freddom project. At the time I didn't have a lot of info but a lot of animation. Gavin said it looked fine but add a lot more info and keep the animations because there functional and look good. Jenny said the same thing but I had a lot of info at the time so she didn't say anything about the info but made a suggestion to instead of adding columns to use hr tags instead because they would look more suitable for my layout. I think both of there feedback helped a lot with the final project so I thank them for that.
