  <h1> Categories </h1>
  <p> 3D models can be divided into two categories. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Solid – These models define the volume of the object they represent (like a rock). Solid models are mostly used for engineering and medical simulations, and are usually built with constructive solid geometry </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Shell or boundary – These models represent the surface, i.e. the boundary of the object, not its volume (like an infinitesimally thin eggshell). Almost all visual models used in games and film are shell models. </li>
  </ul>

<p> Solid and shell modeling can create functionally identical objects. Differences between them are mostly variations in the way they are created and edited and conventions of use in various fields and differences in types of approximations between the model and reality..</p>

<h3> Motion Tracking </h3>

<p> This also shows a lot of representation because it allows you to make your 3D Model do a really cool action. Look for more details in the <a href="technology.html"> Technology </a> section. </p>
